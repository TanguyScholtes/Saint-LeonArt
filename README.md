# Saint-LeonArt

## What is Saint-LeonArt ?
Saint-LeonArt is a Wordpress theme created for the Web Projects course of the Haute École de la Province de Liège (Belgium). This theme was tailored to suit the wills and needs of [Lencreuse](https://lencreuse.be/) regarding Saint Léon'Art, a yearly event that takes place in the neighborhood of Saint Léonard, in Liège (Belgium).  

## About the event Saint LéonART
Saint Léon'Art is an event taking place once a year in Saint Léonard, a neighborhood in Liège. In this occasion, many artists from the city and above meet to exhibit their works of art in various locations around the neighborhood. In addition, Saint Léon'Art organizes many events around the art course from exhibit to another, such as a lantern ball, concerts, dances and more.  
The will of this event is to take the art close to the people, to breake that elitist image often associated with art and make it enjoyable for everyone. Saint Léon'Art is also the perfect place for an artist to promote his or her artworks and for an exhibition gallery to get discoverd by people who would perhaps never have entered it.

## Prerequisites
As far as development goes, these are the plugins required for the theme. Please keep in mind that the development is still in progress and thus this list is far from being final.
- [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) version 5 or greater (PRO version will probably be necessary by the end of the project)
- [Post Type Archives Link](https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-archive-links/)
- [MailChimp for WordPress](https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/)

The following plugins are recommended but not required :
- [Wordpress Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/), to seed Wordpress' database with content and get you started straight away

## How to install ?
There is not much to install yet. At this state, the theme would be far from functionnal, so we recommend not installing it for now.
