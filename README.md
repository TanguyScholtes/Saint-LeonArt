# Saint-LeonArt

## What is Saint-LeonArt ?
Saint-LeonArt is a Wordpress theme created for the Web Projects course of the Haute École de la Province de Liège (Belgium). This theme was tailored to suit the wills and needs of [Lencreuse](https://lencreuse.be/) regarding Saint Léon'Art, a yearly event that takes place in the neighborhood of Saint Léonard, in Liège (Belgium).  

## About the event Saint LéonART
Saint Léon'Art is an event taking place once a year in Saint Léonard, a neighborhood in Liège. In this occasion, many artists from the city and above meet to exhibit their works of art in various locations around the neighborhood. In addition, Saint Léon'Art organizes many events around the art course from exhibit to another, such as a lantern ball, concerts, dances and more.  
The will of this event is to take the art close to the people, to breake that elitist image often associated with art and make it enjoyable for everyone. Saint Léon'Art is also the perfect place for an artist to promote his or her artworks and for an exhibition gallery to get discoverd by people who would perhaps never have entered it.

## Prerequisites
None for now, as the theme doesn't exist yet. But I can safely say it will require the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin.

## How to install ?
There isn't anything to install yet.
